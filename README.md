# Training CSS Grid

Another challenge proposed by DIO.me, this time the challenge was to reproduce the YouTube home page, specifically the YouTube list videos from home page using Grid Layouts. 
**The page its not responsible, it was intended to Full HD screens (1920x1080).**


## What i used?
This time, i utilized my pre-knowledge about flexbox to built the frame of the page, like top nav and the sidebar, the main content i used Grid Layout like proposed, this was fun, and i had a opportunity to practice my CSS skills even more. The proposed challenge was more simple, so to i challenge myself i tried to copy exact the same today YouTube appearance (03/09/2024).
